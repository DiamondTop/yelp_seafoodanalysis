1,Shanghai_joe,mostreviewed1,"Made the trip to Chinatown to pick-up from Joe's Shanghai (via Seamless/Grubhub) and it was well worth the effort. We had the Pork Meat Soup Dumplings and a Scallion Pancake for appetizers and both were excellent. We even managed to get the Soup Dumplings home intact (though we accidentally punctured a couple of them In serving them). Though they probably would have been even better if we had been able to eat them in the restaurant, they were still very much a treat. For our main dish, we had the Peking Duck and it was also very well done. It came with the usual accompaniments (wraps, scallions, cucumbers and hoisin sauce) and was perfect for sharing. The service was friendly and efficient. They have a table setup right inside the door and the food was well packaged for travel. Great choice for pick-up or delivery! 
Joe's Shanghai is a place that is sure to please almost everyone, whether you prefer authentic Chinese or Chinese/American; Joe's Shanghai has a very extensive menu. I always order their Xiao Long Bao or ""soup dumplings,"" made with pork or pork and crab. They are loaded with meat and broth, and if you order takeout, make sure to eat them right away or the broth inside the dumplings will disappear and get absorbed quickly. Another staple of this wonderful restaurant is their stir fried rice cakes. I usually get the seafood fried rice cakes, which are loaded with the scalloped rice cakes, scallion, mushroom, shrimp, scallops, onion, and whitefish. Another wonderful dish that they make is the seafood casserole, also made with scallops, shrimp, whitefish, crab, and various veggies such as lettuce, mushroom, lotus root and water chestnuts. This is a place unlike no other in NYC, and kind of in the middle between authentic Shanghai and Chinese American. Just visit this place if you're in town!
One of my last stops before the quarantine. Good enough to get my Chinese fix before I'm locked in. Chinatown was already pretty quiet by the time I visited so we had no wait despite coming on a Saturday night at 7pm. The restaurant was still pretty packed though. Service isn't super friendly but they got us everything we needed so no complaints there. Very clean and a comfortable dining experience if you don't speak the language (aka it's more tourist friendly than some other spots in Chinatown).For our meal my friend and I got the following:1) Pork XLB: TON of soup and very thin skin. Two of my top requirements. Plus they held up very well. My only gripe is that the filling's flavor isn't as good as other spots. It's still delicious but felt like it was missing something to make it a bit lighter Crispy Whole Fish w/ Garlic Sauce: Really nice flaky fish. Sauce was a bit on the salty side and fairly garlicky but one note. Solid but no urge to order this again  Seafood Fried Rice Cake: Usually a pretty easy dish to make at home so I have slightly higher expectations at a restaurant but nothing special. Seafood wasn't too chewy and there was a good amount of it. Rice cakes were cut a bit thicker than I like. Flavor was also very one note. Not bad but also no desire to order this again Overall, I enjoyed my meal here and if you're coming back the XLB is definitely the item to get. But the prices are steeper, there's probably gonna be a wait, and the other items are just alright. So in general I'd probably opt for Shanghai Dumpling instead.
Came here with my team, and although it's not very enticing to serve a group of teenagers who don't look very rich or like very good tippers, they did just that! Service was fast and polite, and all our dishes came within reasonable times. The XLB is bomb as always, with the soup piping hot and delicious. The Peking Duck leaves a little to be desired, but for a restaurant serving Peking Duck in Manhattan at such a price, I wasn't expecting the same taste as I would expect in Beijing. We stayed past their closing time, but they didn't rush us and didn't even give us dirty looks! In fact, they were very patient and nice, and we made sure to express our appreciation in our tip. 10/10 would recommend!
Insta@dish_360 The Good: We wanted the best soup dumplings and both Google and Yelp pointed us to Joe's Shanghai. We got the crab and pork meat soup dumplings. Okay, so basically it's a dumpling that has your protein of choice and when you bite down the soup pours out. Absolutely. Frikkin. Delicious. We also had the scallion pancake which was crisp and addicting. Texturally, they complimented the dumplings and didn't feel too ""heavy."" The Bad: Cash only. NBD they had an ATM on site. Also, the wait staff is not pleasant by any means ¬ not a deal breaker for us. I saw other reviews that echoed this sentiment. Honestly, I don't care as much about service as a lot of people do. I'd go back for the dumplings as long as the quality in the kitchen held up. ‚Äç I'm also not a fan of the shared tables. We just aren't social enough to want to share a table with a bunch of people we don't know but that's personal preference. Aftermath: This isn't an intimate date night spot. We tried the items they're known for and we left happy. We'd be back but I'm not sure if I'd explore the rest of the menu. It's not a place I would care to sit and spend a lot of time at. I'd eat what I knew was going to be executed well and then leave. Insta@ dish_360
Honestly, pretty average Xiao Long Bao, I'm not sure why its so popular here. We ordered that and the crispy noodles with meat, veggies and gravy sauce over it, and both dishes were pretty mediocre. The soup dumplings were hot, which was nice, and came with the typical sauce, but overall there was nothing too special about them. They tasted like the kind you could get at any soup dumpling place, there was no need to wait in a giant line just to try it here. I Never wanted to try Joe's Shanghai based on a hunch it's american (white people) asian food. Well, the restaurant was just around where I was, so why not? We ordered 2 dishes : fried dumplings and pork soup dumplings, solely because that's what they are ""famous"" for. Big disappointment. The dumpling skin is fine, not too thick, and the soup was just fine, but the meat was lacking of almost any real depth of flavour. Usually fried dumplings are hard to get wrong in any other restaurant because they are so basic, yet joe's Shanghai failed on both. Both dishes had almost no flavour. We had to ask for chili paste/hot sauce, and even their hot oil chili paste also had almost no taste LOL. Sorry, this one is all hype and there are better Shanghainese restaurants in NYC Service just hit or miss. Its not bad but it's not great. It's asian restaurant in chinatown anyway. And they put 15% ""service charge"" automatically on the check. I just pitied them and add $1 extra tip on top of the service charge for $16 food ( before tax and tip ) so total I gave the mediocre service 25%. I live in NYC so I'm not a big fan when they put the tip automatically for party of 2. My assumption maybe is tourists' area and generally they don't tip. Oh well....Not recommend this place. Unless u want to eat mediocre food. For Xiao long bao I suggest "" Nang Xiang Xiao long bao"" in flushing
Well Joe's congratulations on the new location! It's more accessible, bigger, brighter, and a huge upgrade looks wise than its original location. Although I'll surely miss the original spot because it had so much character! If you want to beat the crowds, try getting there around 11-11:30ish, which we did and our party of 8 waited less than 20 minutes.New spot, same menu, same prices (surprising). Any trip to NYC meant a stop for XLBs at Joe's. At the new location, these are still really good! Definitely worth a try if you are a fan of XLBs.What was disappointing was that the fried rice and the green beans don't have the same flavor. The fried rice used to be bright and moist. This visit ¬ it was darker and dry. ¬ Which is sad because I used to love their fried rice. The green beans also took a step back, leaving me wondering, where'd the flavor go?? Maybe the need time to break in the new kitchen, but until then, I can only remember the memories of what used to be remarkable
Came in for a quick bite since I was in the area.Ended up getting the vegetable dumplings and F2 Seafood Saut√©ed flat noodles.The dumplings were not that great IMHO and the noodles were just okay. ¬ Maybe the location in Flushing is better?The wait time for a table was non existent at around 630pm on a Wednesday, but quickly got busy as I was about to leave.The free orange slices for dessert were nice.The service was so-so, but didn't need too much I guess.
Delicious soup dumplings! My family is Shanghainese so I'm always looking for an authentic place for my taste buds. I'm really happy that I found this place to curb my appetite for soup dumplings, which before moving into the city, I've only been able to eat when I'm in Shanghai. For sure get the soup dumplings! It comes out in a steaming basket and is super hot so make sure to let it cool a bit. This place has a huge line - I was here at 9:30 pm on Saturday and waited 15-20 minutes for a table. You might end up getting seated with another party if you have fewer people.
The staff did not pay attention or come to your table unless you called for them. They stood around until they were called for. Even if you were ready to order and you looked like you are ready to order, they did not go over to you unless you called them over.I was okay with sharing a table since it's often done in Chinese restaurants. But usually, there is a seat in between you and the separate party. We were elbow to elbow on a Tuesday afternoon and each time the large group spun the rotating tray or turntable in the middle, it would bump something. I sat with a seat in between at first and they were very insisted on having me move over (told me 4 times lol) and I eventually did. Turns out, they planned on putting another group of 2 at the same table, which now consisted of 3 groups (2 groups of 2 and a group of 6). This was my first experience at a restaurant sitting elbow to elbow with strangers when there were more than enough EMPTY tables for us to have sat a seat apart, more than enough tables for each group to have had our own tables. Was not the communal seating I expected or have always experienced. The pork soup dumpling tasted homemade, but the same usual filling that other restaurants and stores sell. Still delicious soup dumplings. I order Szechuan food for the spicy kick, I could not taste the spice, but I saw a small amount of Szechuan sauce. Tasted like any other beef noodle soup. tl;dr - overhyped, most likely won't visit anymore and if I do, its a no to sharing a table. (They don't usually ask you to share if its a group that fits their open table sizes; they have tables for groups of 2,4, and 10)
What happened to Joe shanghai? This used to be my go-to place for soup dumplings in Chinatown but it recently moved to a new location nearby. The decor is much nicer and the space is bigger but everything else went downhill. Our soup dumplings came out first. We had a order of the pork soup dumplings and a order of the crab and pork soup dumplings. They were filled with plenty of soup inside and the flavor was good. However, the skin of the dumpling was a bit too thick and overpowered the filling. Throughout my whole dining experience here, the service was odd and unorganized. Before we even had a chance to look through the menu, a server was standing behind us waiting to take our order. After we ordered our food, we asked for a cup of tea but yet they came back with a plate of cold chicken instead that we didn't order. When we were almost done with our meal, we inquired about one of the missing items we ordered earlier and he told us he didn't put the order through. Why did he say okay when we placed the order then? They also put a vegetarian noodle dish on our table but another waiter rushed over to take it back since it didn't belong to us. We ordered the beef pan fried noodles. When it finally arrived, the noodles were nice and crispy and there was a good variety of ingredients inside. However, we thought the dish was way too salty!
This was our first time eating in Chinatown and it was a good stop. The process of getting a table is a bit hectic and unorganized. They give you a number and an approximate wait time. Since ours was 1.5 hours, we decided to leave for about 45 minutes. Based on a lot of people doing this, it seems like we probably could have been seated while we were gone if we hadn't left. After getting back we waited about 20-30 minutes before being seated. Onto the food.. it's important to know that it's cash only, but they have an ATM there if you don't come prepared. We got scallion pancakes and pork soup dumplings for appetizers. I wasn't impressed with the scallion pancakes. The soup dumplings, as expected, were the star of the entire meal. I've only had them elsewhere once before, but this time I came prepared and figured out how to eat them before we came. I wasn't impressed with previous soup dumplings, but these ones are amazing. Make sure to get them. For entrees, a few of us split the Shanghai Flat Noodles, the Singapore Chow Mei Fun, and the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup. We really enjoyed everything. I was probably most impressed by the soup. I definitely thought it was worth the wait to come here. I'd recommend just staying there and waiting since the wait will probably be shorter than advertised.
Joe's shanghai is a solid chinese restaurant but honestly the xiao long bao was not that amazing in my opinion. Maybe it's because I've been spoiled by xiao long bao from the streets of Shanghai, but these were nowhere near what they were hyped up to be. The XLB had more soup/juice than any others I've had in the US, but I felt like the flavor was sort of average. Better than Din Tai Fung for sure though (but then again, I think DTF is like a 2/5 lol)But 4 stars because despite it not living up to hype, this place still has great food and is not one of those ridiculously overpriced asian restaurants. They give big portions and their prices are super reasonable given how famous they are. Aside from one order of XLB, my friend and I got a beef fried rice which was delicious, and we were actually struggling so hard to finish it. Moreover, the service is one of the best I've experienced at a Chinese restaurant -- not that I really care about the service at Chinese restaurants (because usually there is an inverse relationship between quality of service and quality of food at these places haha), but it was impressive. Also, lots of great dessert places within walking distance in Chinatown!
These soup dumplings are probably the only reason I'd move from California to freezing NY!! I'd give this place more than 5 stars if I could!!Came here Saturday at 1pm and the wait was maybe ~15-20min for a party of 4. We ordered the crab with pork meat soup dumpling and the pork meat soup dumpling. They were bothhhh so good. Soupy, hot, flavorful, and delicious! I'd add more adjectives if my vocabulary was better. If I had any slight preference, it'd be the regular pork soup dumpling because it's a little cheaper...meaning I can eat more dumplings. The crab one also had a crab flavor so idk how much of those I can eat in one go. My family also ordered the Shanghai Noodle Soup. I only had a sip of soup but my first impression was it's oily. We also got the Jajiangmein....which no one wanted to finish. I'd recommend skipping these two and just ordering the soup dumplings.
I went here with a friend at around 2pm on a Tuesday and there were people waiting outside. We got a number and the hostess said that it would be about a 45 minute wait. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes around anytime. We decided to walk around and went to Tiger Sugar, which is close by. By the time we got back I think our number was passed but it was fine. She told us to go inside and wait on the line to be called. After about 10 minutes we were seated. The new location is very modern. The tables could be bigger. When you sit down they bring you tea and water. We ordered the Pork Friend Dumplings ($7.95), which were very good and came with 8 dumplings. Of course we ordered their famous Pork Soup Dumplings ($7.95). It comes with 8 and they are my top 2 favorite soup dumplings in Manhattan Chinatown. They are large and delicate so be careful when picking them up. The broth is plentiful and expect it to fill your whole spoon. We got an order of General Tso Chicken ($17.95), which was perfectly crispy with a little spice. Chicken Fried Rice ($10.25), which is exactly what you want in fried rice. The bowl was never-ending and we were able to take some home. This place is cash only so be sure to stop at the multiple banks on your way to the restaurant. This place is pricier than most in Chinatown, but if you are looking for quality I recommend trying it out.
Joe's Shanghai is the spot you bring your friends who are visiting NYC -- total tourist spot. That being said, the quality of the food does not disappoint and it's overall a stellar experience. The location has moved from Pell St. to Bowery so trade the older, kinda funny (XLB + vinegar) smelling space for a new modern, clean look. It's in prime location and during rush hours it'll most definitely attract an impressive crowd. Must orders:- Scallion pancake- Shanghai fried flat noodles- XLBs! pork... try the crab too! You can get most of the standard banquet-style Chinese foods here... it's all solid. Don't forget to add an overpriced veggie -- gotta get that fiber!
It's the newly renovated Joe's Shanghai and to many some of the best soup dumplings they've ever had. To me I'm happy that the bathrooms are cleaner and the restaurant is renovated, it really makes a difference without taking too much of a hit to the prices of the entrees. But with all popular Chinatown tourist spots you will feel the pressure to leave your table quickly after the meal. In addition the restaurant is cash only despite the renovation. They also add a 15% service charge which is automatic to the bill. Lastly as a fan of Din Tai Fung I found the soup dumplings here not as good as DTF. 4 stars for the quick food and new ambiance.
I came to New York knowing I wanted soup dumplings. My aunt did her research and found this place. AMAZING SOUP DUMPLINGS! The place was very small and it is packed! They don't take reservations and seating is on a first come, first serve basis. After waiting for 30 minutes, we were finally seated. Besides the packed restaurant and the long wait, this place was amazing. I heard they are expanding soon, so that will probably eliminate the waiting and space issue. I will definitely be coming back!",Seafood
2,Eataly,mostreviewed2,"I have been going to this place to eat at their restaurants, and shop food. But because if the Pandemic, I solved my problem when I found out I could order food and groceries from here.  Although not everything is in their internet, you can submit a request. The first delivery they had was great! Then I went for a second time but I think I may have had someone else's bag. But they made up by checking my order and bringing it the next day. I think even after all is fine and the pandemic is gone, I am glad to know that I can just order their groceries online. I can also buy vegetables and fruits!
Today I ordered a pizza - tartufo. The Server said it was thin. But it was on the thick side.  I am very disappointed.  It was also not crisp. I wish they would be consistent.  When I First tasted their pizza when their place just opened downtown and the pizza was thin and crisp. The one I had tonight was not crisp at all. It was like a thin open face sandwich. But I did not want to wait for a redo.
I eat here and I buy food hard to find like puntarelle, and cheese with grape vine leaves. Their variety of coffee are all delicious. I get UNI here, razor clams and other fresh fish when I am not in the other places I usually go to. It's my other grocery place and sometimes for a quick bite of vegetarian or seafood. They also carry mandarin and lemon olive oil that's hard to find.
Although the food was good, I found the $100 plus if you had wine a bit more expensive since the recipes were really simple. If they are not giving me the recipe the night I attended and just explained the wines more (which I opted out) than the proportions of the recipe to make the dishes, I think keeping the tab 15% less would have been more appropriate and I probably would have given it a extra star. They did not even show us how they made the chicken liver pate - nothing was described in this ""school"". If not, maybe I should have at least the written recipe from the ""school""? I have taken other classes where they charged less and includes wine. ¬ Also good wine with discount that night for attending the class. ¬ I get to take home and try at least one of the dishes that night.
Best experience ever. You can order takeout in advance. we ordered from ubereats. They even gave us complimentary treat in our bag. They only allow a limited number of ppl to enter at a time and pickup isna separate section. Food is good. Just be careful when you order online. Sometimes the pictures dont match the descriptions and in one of our orders we accidentally ordered the wrong item by looking only at the picture (it was a cream pasta picture we ordered but when the food came out it was tomato pasta...we looked into it and the descriptions were tomato) that was a bit of a expectation bummer but other than that delicious! The burrata is BOMB. We took it out for our faux picnic in our living room to celebrate our four year anniversary IG eatsumbap
This is specifically a review of the La Pizza Pasta restaurant. My wife and I split two incredible dishes for lunch. She adored her rigatoni in lemon sauce with pistachio. I was not quite what I was looking for but I recognized the quality. I opted for the sausage and fennel special that was absolutely amazing. Warm and flavorful, it was a perfect pasta dish. You truly cannot go wrong by opting for the special of the day. We strolled in when Eataly opened and the restaurant had ample seating. However, the tables were packed by noon, so arrive early! Outside of the restaurant there is plenty of shopping to be had for food and food-related items. I think the primary reason you should visit is to dine-in, it's worth it!
I visited Serra By Berriera recently (before the quarantine) with 3 of my friends. I want to say this place is amazing and yes, by just looking at the decor - it is! The ambiance of Eataly and this restaurant is honestly breathtaking and it is extremely enjoyable to dine in.However, if you are looking for great service with a diverse menu I would not recommend here. The service was honestly quite terrible. We had a reservation and still had to wait at least 30 minutes for our table. We decided to get drinks at the bar, which was extremely packed, during our wait. The bartender was attentive and our drinks were delicious but expensive (which was expected) and had a lot of ice. The worst part was our server. She greeted us and then took forever to come back. She asked if we were ready to order so I responded yes, for drinks because we had not decided on our meals yet. However she just assumed that were ONLY ordering drinks, which we were not and gave us an attitude from then on. After our drinks were delivered she then took forever to come back and check on us. Then we were finally able to tell her that we were ready to order and she decided to change her tune once she realized we were actually ordering dinner. I ordered the truffle risotto, the flavor was absolutely delicious. Although, I think the dish could have used some other elements besides only rice. Overall, ambiance is amazing. I would return for drinks at the bar but most likely not for a meal.
This is such a super cool shopping and eating experience. Whether you eat in the pasta or pizza restaurant, you will not be disappointed. Just the experience of walking through the food counters makes you hungry! Lots of options. Fresh pasta. Fresh seafood. As a first time visitor to the city, this was a wonderful experience. You can grocery shop, sip on wine, share a meat and cheese platter, eat freshly made pasta, pizza, fish dishes or just soak up the atmosphere. So much fun! I wish we could have stayed longer. A must when you are in NYC!
A ""Trip to Eataly opens the door to Italy"" this is opposite to Madison square park ( mind it not garden) or let me put it this way, near to Flatiron Building. This wasn't your typical Italian restaurant! A ""trip to Eataly opens the door to Italy,"" is how this Italian food megastore is described. Eataly is complete with: Different dining areas Two coffee bars A wine tasting and small plate areaThe most complete Italian food marketplace in the city offering fresh produce, specialty foods A gourmet food appliance section and Venchi Chocolate section My first impression was wow, what a fabulous new food concept! For over a half an hour I wandered around exploring the different sections. Everything looks so delicious, I could hardly decide what I wanted to have. we tried Gelato, hot coffee, bought a bit of Venchi chocolates and a few pieces of cheese for our home. if you are nearby, it definitely deserves your one visit.
The best place on earth! You can find everything here from great foods to great deserts, ingredients and a real Italian experience. They have very interesting information on every corner of this place about breads, wines, pastas and much more. Unique Italian ingredients that cannot be found anywhere else in the US . Ice Cream is great, Gelato is beyond great, pasta was amazing, pizza is so goooood, we also bought a few groceries including pasta , pastries, olive oils sauces and all of them are so good. What can I say more about this market ? Never disappoints .
Doesn't get much better than this- finding the hidden elevator in the back of this enormous Costco of Italian gourmet cuisine, then taking it up to the 4th floor rooftop bar that's exploding with flowers. The drinks up on the 4th floor cocktail bar area are refreshing on a hot summer day and the view across the city is priceless! Pro-tip, the marketplace area is perfect for a souvenir- beware of buying chocolate though- keep in mind it can melt on your way home in the hot NYC summer heat! There are also plenty of restaurants nearby that are less expensive, but if you're here you gotta experience the food, which honestly is pretty reasonable for NYC. Highlight of Manhattan and a must-go if you're even tangentially interested in Italian cuisine.
I love coming to Eataly, it's a must do every time I'm in the city.  The staff really care about what they do too.  They're into the fresh mozzarella they make or the history of the prosciutto they're slicing and handing out.  You can sense their enthusiasm when they talk about what's fresh and what's new (aside from the one arrogant bartender that works the rooftop bar...but I'll won't slam the rest of the place because of him).Most of the time I hang in La Piazza, grab some antipasti and wine.  It's relaxing and gives me some reprieve from the hustle of the NYC streets. The produce is beautiful too so I always grab something that is in season and looks great!  But no matter what you want they definitely have it.  Everything Italian all the time.
Strangely, the one thing I expected to really love about Eataly -- the food -- wasn't memorable. Five of us grabbed lunch at La Piazza, a good spread of pastas, pizza, beer and wine, and I wasn't paying the bill, but judging by the menu prices I expected better. Eataly's best bets are the endless products, both imported and produced daily in-house, that can bring Italy into your home kitchen. Anything I could imagine, from cured meats and fine cheeses to unique breads and a tasty cup of gelato for the road, it was all there. And we are talking about one of the best countries on the planet, right? Of course everything's yummy.
First time visiting Eataly and it did not disappoint. First let's talk about the fact that there is a dedicated 2 stories to wine...what could be bad about that. We ate dinner at La Pizza & La Pasta. It was delicious! The house red wine is better than expected. The Brussels sprouts to start were so tasty and I would highly recommend the Crostini, the flavors are perfect. Wear what you please, some people are grabbing a bite after shopping, some on dates and some dropping by after work. The servers are helpful and attentive so don't be afraid to ask questions. The atmosphere is fun, it's bustling- there are people everywhere and it's a mix of places to eat woven through a perfect Italian grocery stop.
Authentic Italian sweets, hot chocolate to go, freshly pulled pasta...What's not to love? I am often in this area of NYC near the Flatiron building and love popping in to Eataly. Yes, it's a bit touristy (but you also see locals grabbing a few savory items for dinner) but it's in a central spot and full of neat items you don't see at every food spot. For the holidays, they import specialty items from Italy, including panettone and hard candies with beautiful tin packaging. A friend with Italian parents remarked it's the real deal goods that you find in Italy. ¬ Pricing it a bit high but not too crazy- not a place I'd regularly buy grocery goods at every week, but perfect for special occasions or a splurge. If you are looking to dine there, they have several bustling options downstairs ranging from wine bars to coffee/gelato spots, as well as a rooftop restaurant (I recommend!) ¬ that decorates for the holidays as well.
I loved exploring Eataly while I was visiting NYC earlier this week. It's an Italian market slash restaurant where you can find genuine imported goods from Italy- I loved marveling at the unique packaging for candies and pastas- and the big chocolate Easter bunnies! The prices are a bit high and it is usually bustling with customers, but I also found reasonably priced candy souvenirs- absinthe, violet, and anise-flavored Leone candies in adorable packaging. I hear there is a rooftop beer garden here too that I'd love to check out next time.
Disclaimer ""three stars is not a bad review"".... but Eataly ain't what it used to be when I worshipped this place 6-7 years ago. Lots of reviews here talking about bad service, not true, at least for me. Went to the beautiful rooftop for the atmosphere. We had the best and most friendly service. Walked around the market/shops, and looked at the rotisserie sandwich shop. Re sandwiches, they were still shaving prime rib to order, but the bread was smaller. ¬ The pasta is still a rip-off, and the meat counter has stuff you can't get at the average butcher, but you'll pay for it. It is truffle season, and as a guy that loves um, I couldn't pass up the Urbani stand by Manzo. Wow! ¬ They were in the ground a day ago, and couldn't resist the shaved chips over everything. As for the espresso station, it was as good as I remember from back in the day. The machine is tens of thousands of dollars, and if it gets dented, they have to bring it to an auto body shop. Only issue is the Battista now asks you to pay at the pastry register. That line was way too long with annoying tourists so I just left my money on the counter and left. I get it, location is prime, and that jacks up the prices, and if you want value, this is not your place - which is why I think Eataly Flatiron is perfectly rated at 3ish stars.
I went to La Piazza and really loved it! It was restaurant fest and we got some stuff off the menu as well as some other dishes off the regular menu such as the meat board. My favorite dish was the risotto ball and Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were so perfectly cooked - hint of vinegar and crispy perfection on the outside. It was crowded when I went and seats are first come, first serve. The service was good. The food was great and came quickly. Busy atmosphere but lovely nonetheless. Would recommend if you're in Eataly!
My friends and I made reservations for Eataly La Pizza and La Pasta for their Restaurant Fest 2-course lunch special. We got everything on the special menu and a bottle of white wine and it was a pleasant enough meal, but nothing mind-blowing. Their margherita pizza (not pictured) was my favorite with delicious sauce and bread and melty cheese. The atmosphere was bustling (a little cramped) but the service was really great. Browsing the market afterwards is nice and you can get miscellaneous desserts or souvenir-gifts for people.

3,ippudo_ramen,mostreviewed3,"I love this style of Ramen - such a satisfying bowl of noodles (house made) and rich broth. ¬ We had the Blistered Shishito peppers with cirtus salt which were superb. The BEST news is that I found out they have 2 locations in Los Angeles!  Can't wait to try more of their menu at home.  They also have some pretty unique SAKI - milky and chunky but sweet and delicious. My vegetarian husband had the VEGETARIAN version of the Ramen I had and the broth was amazing as well.  He actually went back today!
After saying 'yes' to the dress (WAHOO!), Mom and I needed a lunch spot in the area. She loves ramen, so I wanted her to try Ippudo. It was still pretty crowded for a Sunday at 2:30. My mom had the Akamaru Modern (The original silky ""tonkotsu"" (pork) soup noodles topped with ippudo's secret ""umami dama"" miso paste, pork chashu, cabbage, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and fragrant garlic oil). I went with the special, the Miso Akamaru Ramen (tonktosu pork soup mixed with 3 kinds of Japanese miso, sliced pork chashu, sansho minced pork, scallion, thinly sliced leeks, Akamiso paste, and garlic oil. The broth was a bit salty for my taste, but everything else was good. We weren't going to get any starters but then we saw someone get the chicken karaage, and couldn't resist. I'm glad we did because it came out perfect - piping hot and tender. My only gripe was that they don't offer takeout, so we couldn't even get the leftovers to go. We had to force ourselves to eat some extra chicken, which I guess isn't the worst thing in the world. Also, our waitress definitely paid no attention to us.Overall, a solid spot for ramen!
This is the first Ippudo that I had been to and i am such a fan. My friend and I ordered a fried chicken as appetizer and I also ordered a drink (Pomm Choi) to start. Fried chicken is definitely a solid choice - very tender and juicy. It comes with five pieces and was garnished with shishito peppers. For main course, i ordered Karaka spicy- rich broth, nice balance between spiciness and saltiness. The tonkotsu is on point. I am usually very skeptical on tonkotsu because i am not a particular fan of pig-fat. However, the tonkotsu at ippudo has a nice fat-to-meat ratio and goes well with the pork broth. Also, just a reminder, the ramen do not comes with seaweed or egg (not sure if that is the standard package with tonkotsu ramen). For the price, ippudo is a pretty decent place for a casual dinner.
Ippudo, with many locations across the country is outrightly one of the most popular Ramen places in the US. With multiple locations across NYC, we visited the one on 51st Street on a Friday night. We reached at about 7:05 PM with over an hour waiting. We put our names down and waited for our turn. There is a nice bar for those who want to grab a drink while waiting. Across the bar(alcohol) is a is a big Ramen bar. For those who arrive by themselves or in a couple, they can grab a table at the Ramen bar. It is spacious and with views of the open kitchen.We finally got our table at about 8:15. The tables are quite close to each other. The restaurant was quite loud. Our server was nice and warm.Edamame:The popular vegetable comes with citrus salt. At most places, the edamame is fried. Here, they weren't fried. I enjoying eating healthy and was surprised with this change. It was lovely. The citrus salt is unusual. The sour and tangy flavor with edamame is a lovely flavor. This appetizer is healthy and tasty.Tofu & Nasu Agedashi:Definitely our favourite appetizer here. Fried tofu served in mushroom broth accompanied with grated ginger. The broth is flavoured with garlic. The taste of mushrooms isn't too noticeable and all the ingredients together are a delight. However, the broth definitely does have a strong flavour. Hence for those who prefer subtle flavours, this one definitely isn't for you. About 3 big pieces of deep fried tofu are included. Nirvana Shiromaru with Bakudan:I generally add a Bakudan to my ramen. It is a ball made with garlic and red chilly. You can add it to the ramen for a spicy flavor.The broth in itself was amazing. Extremely flavorful. The ginger and garlic combination is one of my favorites and I really enjoyed the flavor. The broth is not very watery. Its consistency is slightly thick(like a thin soup). The signature thin noodles with fungi, mushrooms and scallions all blend perfectly. Totally loved it.
OH MY LORD. SO AMAZING. Wait was super long and no reservation. Went to the other location and they're both perfect. I get the traditional tonkotsu on the menu and it was perfect and serving size was big!
Ippudo Westside is better than Ippudo East Village in my opinion!I think this location is a bit more spacious, especially considering the waiting area, and I like how brightly lit the counter is (as well as the fact that it's in the center of the restaurant). I had passed by this Ippudo location a couple times but never stepped in due to the intimidating wait time. However, we were able to get a seat at the counter after waiting for only 15 minutes during prime dinner time on a Sunday. The service was pretty efficient--we got glasses of water/menus were already placed at our seats, and we didn't have to wait long between ordering and getting our ramen. In the past, I had never been too impressed by Ippudo's ramen, but I had a fresh appreciation for the Akamaru Modern. The noodles were delicious, and I finished all the broth (not too salty)! If you're in the area and craving ramen, I do think this is worth the hype and worth going to (as long as you're not waiting an obscene amount of time).
4.5/5This is my first time visiting New York and knowing that the city is basically a food galore, I was excited to try out their ramen and was not disappointed. With origins from Japan and now locations worldwide, Ippudo is a ramen shop well loved by many locals and tourists. We arrived around 5:25pm and waited around 30-40 minutes before being seated at the bar. Place is small but dim and intimate. Waiters are well trained and friendly.We started off with 2 Ippudo pork buns. Buns were smaller than expected but still juicy and delicious. Pork belly slices are on the thinner side, different from the thicker slices you would typically get at Taiwanese restaurants, which is what I like.For ramen I ordered Akamaru Modern, which showcases their signature ""Umami Dama"" miso paste. I loved the tonkatsu (pork) broth, it was deep, rich, and flavorful. The layered flavor really transported me back to my time in Japan and was a close authentic replica to the ramen I had there. Broth may be salty alone but well balanced when paired with the thin noodles and fresh toppings. For $2 more, you can order an extra ball of noodles near the end of your meal by saying ""kae-dama, please."" 5/5Loved the ramen. Hope that there will also be an Ippudo location in Portland in the future.
About a 30-45 minute wait around 2 PM on a Thursday. ¬ Not terrible for good ramen. ¬ We started with the pork buns - I expected the pork to be breaded and tossed in sauce but it was juicy the way it was. ¬ Ordered the Karaka spicy ramen and the broth, noodles, and overall dish did not dissapoint. Added the tamago to it too and it was the perfect meal for a cold day. We had some cocktails here too and the lychee one was delicious! Note that they don't allow any takeouts including leftovers. Overall, my experience was good and I would come back for more!
VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY! I was ecstatic to see yummy veggie options in both the appetizer menu and ramen menu. I got the veggie buns for an appetizer. It consists of eggplant and mushroom. The sauce with that combo was so good. My only critique was I felt there was a bit too much mayo, but otherwise, pretty good. I then got the Nirvana ramen with added corn and seaweed. Let me tell you, that was the BEST ramen I've ever tasted. Beats SoCal and definitely beats Philly. The noodles tasted as if they were soaked in the broth for days - soooooo tasty. I didn't even know noodles could carry taste like that. And the broth was very yummy. You could taste the veggie-ness in the yummiest way possible. I can't wait to come back. Oh and the service is awesome. You experience a new class of waiters here. They are very nice, attentive, and well-trained. The whole staff greets each group that walks in. It's not too loud of an environment, but tables are stationed very close to one another. I think I was barely 3 inches from the table / guy to my right. They really try to make the most of their space.
Eh... not as good as the one in East Village. Very dark, food not as good, totally different vibe than the one in East Village. I've had Ippudo several times at the East Village location and I always loved the ramen I got there. I didn't think the broth at this location was as flavorful. Pork buns not as satisfying. I love the East Village layover, this midtown West location just doesn't have the same sleek interior design.
So, really quick: The ramen is great. The Service is great. Unfortunately, they didn't do reservations the last time I went so we had to wait about 40 minutes. It's a good thing though because we got to try some of their appetizers and they were pretty amazing! The wings and pork puns etc. were so tasty. I'm sure lots of people don't get a chance to try them but I think the appetizers are Ippudo's secret weapons. Ramen is cool on a cold day but if you're shooting the breeze with a friend at the bar, get those apps in! P.S. Try the Umentini. Trust me.
I probably like the pork bun more than the ramen itself but. Everything is so good here. They have good service, good ramen and good appetizers. Can you ask for more? They greet you as you come in, serve you water and check up on you a few times during your meal. The only con side is (as w many other terrible nyc thing) they dont take reservations BOO. So you come at 5pm and you get seated. We sat at a shared table (or at bar) and I would say this is one of the smaller locations compared to the other locations I've been. Overall I always love their thin noodles and their spicy level is perfect for me! @eatsumbap
BOOM!  This is it!!!  I think my favorite Ramen place (High-Five in Chicago) just got unseated by this place.   The Tonkatsu broth was phenomenal.  Everything was so flavorful.  The only nit picky thing I have, is the Chasu.  It was good, but overly thin and did not really stand out on its own. It was good with the broth, it was good with the noodles but on its own it was just ok.  That brings me to the noodles.  They were thin, and unlike most ramen noodles people are used to. It took a second for my brain to be ok with this as it was such a deviation from the traditional noodle, but in the end it was very good once I adjusted. :)I recommend coming here early, as my wife and I got here early with our child around 6pm and we got lucky with a 20 minute wait.  We walked around Hell's Kitchen for a while after and when we passed back by this place around 8:30 that night....the wait looked to be around 2 hours.If you are looking for good Ramen around NYC, this is one of the top spots!
Amazing broth and wonderfully flavored meat and eggs. We didn't leave a drop of broth in the bowl!! Would def come back and recommend others to try.
It was nearly an 1.5 hour long (and unworthy) wait on a Thursday evening. We (boyfriend and I) put our names down and decided to walk around. We received a text message once our table was almost ready. I'm very unimpressed with the ramen here - the broth was a bit salty, the noodles were hard, and there were only 2 pieces of meat... I wish we had gone to Ichiran instead.. Nonetheless, the chashu pork buns were on point. Best pork buns ever!!
Listen up folks...there's DIFFERENT types of ramen. And trying to explain this to people who ""love"" ramen, but hate this restaurant is like talking to a wall. So if you're expecting chewy, wavy looking noodles in a clear-ish broth, you're not going to be happy. This is the perfect tonkotsu broth from Fukuoka. The flavor is strong and in comparison to other restaurants serving tonkotsu broth, it's more elegant and traditional. Japanese people won't be happy about the price because it's way cheaper in Japan. It's a chain restaurant like Ichiran and I say that in a positive sense. The thing about chains is that they have managed to get the flavor formula spot on every time. So if you want to know what ramen tastes like in the southern part of Japan, this is where you should go. It's an authentic flavor profile. I know there's some controversy about which location is better, they both taste the same, but I prefer the one in the East Village if I had to choose one. I just think it's prettier. But that's just my preference.
What a cute ramen place! We were in New York for the day and we know there's always great ramen places, and since it was cold.. we went here. Truth, we went here also because online it said they had Okonomiyaki which is MY FAVORITE THING EVER OH GOD because we had it in Japan and it's now my goal to find it in as many US places as possible. Sadly, it was no longer on the menu. I was almost heartbroken. Luckily, I survived. The bar as soon as you walk in is kind of great. You see all the sake and the beers they have on tap, which if you've ever been to Japan, basically all they have on tap is Asahi & Kirin. So we went with some crisp Asahi cause we're trash and buy cases of it whenever possible but that's another story. We started with Pork Buns which were super tasty. I went with just the classic ramen with no ginger (I can't taste it so I avoid it). ¬ The broth was delicious but there were a few things that were.. different. The noodles are very thin which I didn't really care for. They don't seem to hold as much flavor as thicker noodles. I didn't hate it though. Also the pork slices were super thin. Maybe I'm just too used to super thick & fatty pork slices. It wasn't bad by any means, but for sure not the usual ramen I'm used to. Husband had a spicy ramen and basically had the same thoughts. Thin noodles didn't hold as much flavor but it was still really tasty! Just because it was something we weren't used to doesn't mean we won't for sure be back to have more. While the size of the place is actually pretty big, it was very full, there was a wait, but I've never seen staff before that are so efficient at getting people in and out without making it seem like they're rushing you. We were still able to have 2 beers in the short time we ate our ramen and didn't feel rushed at all. Also, just a note, there are steps down to the entrance. Not many, just a few. But there's no ramp. A man and his wife came and he was in a wheelchair and we watched the staff go out just to help pick up his wheelchair and bring him down so he could come in. Good on them for being decent human beings. It was really nice to see.
Food is as good as the other location. If you're a party of two you won't have to wait for the larger  parties to be seated in the dining room. Parties of two are seated at the bar.
The ramen here feels special and I'm so happy this place exists in a sea of theater district restaurants where tourist traps and corporate chains abound. Of course Ippudo is also a chain but a well executed Japanese chain of ramen that feels authentic. The classic tonkotsu ramen is the best but you really can't  go wrong with any of the ramen options on the menu. The broth is ¬ flavorful without being too salty. The noodles are perfectly cooked and definitely add the soft cooked egg. They do it perfectly here. I have even tried tried the vegan ramen and it was great if you ¬ want a lighter option. For appetizers I recommend any of the pork buns and if you are flush with cash definitely spring for the Waygu. This place is always on repeat for me.

4,fish_cheeks,mostrecommended1,"We went here during Restaurant Week 2020. I had heard of it from our Lord and Savior Chrissy Teigen, so I had high expectations.WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. We ordered the Coconut Crab Curry (SPICY), Zabb wings, and crab aob woonsen. My favorite by far was the woonsen...wooooooow. Sweet, savory, lip-smacking good. The curry was spicy, but not so much that I couldn't enjoy it. I understand the hype. The Zabb wings were awesome too -- kind of a lime-y spicy salty seasoning blend that I am pretty sure they sell now. These people have been working so hard during COVID to feed essential workers and it warms my heart. Not only is the food delicious, but they also have great big giant hearts! I cannot wait to go back and continue to support them. I wish I lived close enough to order now!!
Quarantine review: I had been wanting to try Fish Cheeks for a while. Finally had a reservation lined up, then the shut down happened and I never got to go. Fortunately, however, they have been open for take-out, so I have finally gotten to have the Crab Fried Rice I was dying to try and it did not disappoint. Have ordered from here a few times since the shutdown and it's been consistently good. Have also tried the Coconut Crab Curry, it's a little spicy but also very good. If you had been waiting to get a reservation like me, take advantage and try their take-out.Food tips: Crab Fried Rice
I have been coming here for years and I want to say this is my favourite place for Thai. I cannot get enough of their food. Whenever my friends are in town, I always tell them to come here or we would all come here to dine. I hope this place survives the pandemic because I ate here 2x a week and I am always craving their food. In our current situation, I haven't had their food for a long time, but since I had to go to necessary doctor's appointment, I was able to come here for food pickup. I can honestly say, I haven't been this excited for food in such a long time. This place makes me so happy! This restaurant makes the best crab fried rice and their green sauce aka nam jim seafood sauce is to die for. They offer that delicious green goodness on their oysters and I love the hell out of it. The numerous times I have been here, these items below are my stable. Crab Fried Rice - the best thing on earth and the size of the crab lumps are perfect Zabb Wings - these wings have a nice kick to them and they currently are selling the rub. Oysters - the sauce is super addictive and they now sell them too Crab Curry - so yummy and also has a good heat to them Manila Clams - love this dish as well, it reminds of this dish that my mother would make with pipi. Pork Jowl - I usually get this for people who are more meat eaters than seafood, but it is still a solid dish. Mango Sticky Rice - I love this seasonal dessert, they make it so good here. Some places the rice is bland or hard. Please survive the pandemic - you'll be the first restaurant I dine in with friends after we get a vaccine.
Amazing Thai cuisine. Cozy space, efficient service.We loved most dishes, while avoiding the too spicy ones !Manila Clams. Tom Yum. Crab Aob woonsen. Tiger Prawn karee. Yum Hed Yaang.Plenty of food for our group. Definitely worth the visit!
The accolades are warranted. This emperor has new clothes. And they're amazeballs.You like happy hour? You like cheap drinks that are creative and discounted? Come here. Fish Cheeks has one of the best hidden, under-the-radar HHs I've found in Manhattan. Every cocktail is single digits (I think $8?) and full of fun SE Asian ingredients that'll make your tastebuds sing.But the food. Oh glory be, the food. There isn't a single item on the menu that isn't made to perfection and packed with so much umami, your mouth will be culinary mecca. The Pork Cheeks were so crisp, so tender, so perfectly marinated, I still dream about them during lockdown and wake up crying because I live too far to order delivery. The Pomelo salad--full of pomelo, dry-aged fish, cilantro, mint, Thai bird's eye chili, lime, and fried shallot--was the best salad any of us had had in years. We couldn't stop gorging on it like a pack of vultures. Even the simple sauteed cabbage was crisp, garlicky and packed with flavor. It got the seal of approval from one friend who HATES cabbage. How is that possible?I can't wait to throw of the corona shackles and come back here. Fish Cheeks, pleeease don't go away before I can make it back to the LES!
This place is usually super busy and it is very hard to get reservations the day of which is why I recommend you reserve a few weeks to a month in advance. You have to put a credit card on file to book so be aware of that. We ordered the pork cheeks, khua kling, oysters, coconut crab curry, tiger prawn karee and the fried fish. The oysters were surprisingly very good for $1 each. They give you fries shallots and a hot sauce to put on the oysters which added a nice crunch and heat to it.I liked the pork cheeks as well. Not too salty and was surprisingly not too tough. The coconut crab curry was my favorite dish. The crab was soft and broke apart easily and the curry was creamy, savory, and delicious. The tiger prawn karee was good but it was just 3 pieces so I don't think it was worth it for around $30.I wasn't a fan of the fried fish. All the sauce was on the bottom of the plate and wasn't anything special. At the end of the day it was just a regular piece of fried fish. The khua kling was just okay as well. It was basically dry rub spicy beef. Overall this place is good but I like uncle boons better.
If you are thinking of dining here get a Rez now!! My favorite Thai place in the states. Warning you need to be a fan of seafood and can handle some spice to enjoy! I shared the tasting menu for two and left so uncomfortable but still wanted more. The oysters were topped with a fish spicy lime sauce that I wish I could just pour over a bowl of rice or dip something in! Everything was amazing. The corn salad was light and refreshing. The crab curry cannot be missed and the crispy fish! Go hungry! I want this meal again. The wings were crispy and not greasy and the clams were so fresh served in a spicy black bean sauce. I cannot wait to go back here! Be sure to try multiple dishes.
Came here for lunch during restaurant week - made reservations through Resy. Definitely recommend reserving even on the weekdays because there was a wait when we came in on a Thursday around 1pm.We started with the oysters, it was happy hour so they were only $1 and comes with green sauce and fried onions- delicious! The green sauce has a kick to it but added a nice flavor to the oysters.For appetizers, we got the Zabb wings and Somtum corn salad- both were good and a little spicy. They were very generous with the corn salad portion size. The wings are dry rubbed but still tasted flavorful.We got the Green Curry and Crab Aob Woosen for our entree. The green curry was delicious and comes with a side of rice. The glass noodles weren't bad but I preferred the curry over them. The only dessert they had was coconut ice cream so I decided not to get it. Overall a great experience and I can't wait to go back for happy hour (daily between noon to 3:45pm and then 5pm to 7pm) - $10 cocktails, which are usually $15, $1 oysters and $8 wine.Instagram- HungrySimran.
When a classy Thai restaurant is approved and frequented by Chrissy Teigen & her Thai mother, expectations are high and you just know it's going to be good. Fish Cheeks did not disappoint, and certainly offers incredibly high-quality, authentic Thai food.I made a reservation for 2 people @ 7:30pm on a Sunday (Presidents' Day Weekend) almost 3 weeks out, and Resy needs your credit card # in order to complete the reservation -- aka, they don't play around here. We were sat at the table that was basically touching the front door, with a curtain to separate us. Unfortunately we felt the draft all night, so if you're sensitive to chilly temperatures, I'd recommend asking to sit elsewhere for a more enjoyable dining experience. Otherwise, looove the modern yet cozy interior design, especially the hanging fish above the bar. As for the food, we went with Set 2 ($105 for 2 apps + 3 entrees to share between 2 guests). The only thing that fell short was that they had ran out of the Manila Clams, so we had to replace it with another entree of equal or lesser value. We went with the Crab Aob Woonsen... Although I appreciated the fresh pieces of crab meat, it was an underwhelming dish. The glass noodles reminded me of a really cheap & basic Chinese-style vermicelli dish that I can make at home, and there were only like 3 tiny pieces of pork belly in the entire bowl. Not entirely worth it. I think I personally would've preferred egg noodles (instead of glass) instead.However, the whole fried fish, coconut crab curry and apps (fried wings + corn salad) totally made up for it - all were hits. If I could, I'd just melt into that coconut curry... definitely one of the best curries I've ever had. We had a little left over and we insisted on taking it back home - just couldn't let it go to waste. The fried fish was also a standout, as we devoured every piece of it - head and tail included lol. I'm eager to return to try the other whole fishes and the grilled pork cheeks app. Coconut crab curry, also coming back for you.
After hearing so many great things, I really wanted to check this place out. I got the crab fried rice for takeout and it was delicious. There was a perfect amount of savory flavor and the cilantro sauce that accompanied it tasted so delicious. I can't wait to come back here and try their coconut crab curry.
Wow, so my friend invited me here. She used to work here a while back. The place was very nice and the service was excellent. We ordered the Steamed Fish with Thai Herbs, Manila Clams with Sweet Basil and Sauteed Cabbage. Sauteed Cabbage was very flavorful. I was a little surprised how much I enjoyed it. Actually, reminded me of when I was growing up. The Manila clams was excellent. I really enjoyed the sauce/broth it was in. The Steamed Fish was so flavorful. The fish was cooked perfectly and OMG that sauce was excellent. We were treated to a few extra items.... Coconut Crab Curry was excellent. The heat on it was just right, not over powering. Grilled Pork Cheeks and the sauce was yummy. Shrimp Sao with pineapples was very well balanced. I enjoyed the balance of heat and sweetness. I normally do not throw out 5 stars. Everything I ate here I would eat again. There was so much food we couldn't finish everything. I did just want to pack up some of the sauces and use them at home. The balance in the food was great. This is a place where you can taste the love in the food. Thank You Fish Cheeks' staff =)
UM PLEASE TRY THIS PLACE. It's a must, I am so glad I stumbled upon this place. We tried the crab fried rice, which honestly may look bland initially but there was so much flavor packed into each bite. It also came with sauces that really kicked things up a notch. Crab aob woonsen was on the smaller portion for its price but it was still very flavorful with notes of cilantro.Tiger prawn karee is not pictured because I immediately dug into it LOL but 3 huuuge prawns and such a unique flavor profile for the sauce served under the prawns. I just wish it came with jasmine rice to balance out the sauciness. I didn't get to take advantage of their HH but um, can I just mention that its every fricking single day AND extended hours of 12-3:45 pm in addition to the regular 5-7 pm? If that isnt love, idk what is :')
Fantastic Thai restaurant that I had the pleasure of trying last week! My friend recommended this place as he heard great reviews and was able to get a coveted 7:30 reservation through Resy. The restaurant is super cute, though it is on the smaller side. I saw the remainder of the happy hour crowd as we headed to our table, and it definitely seems like a popular place for drinks and food! Our server was great and took our orders for drinks and food very quickly. We ordered the steamed fish, the crab/noodle dish, and the morning glory. Everything was unreal and incredibly well done. The flavor of everything was on point, and I loved the uniqueness of the dishes. My favorite as definitely the crab dish, the spice of the morning glory side went especially well with this one!Everything on their menu looks really great, especially if you're a seafood fan. Definitely will be back to try more!
Fish Cheeks has been the most trendy place for happy hours and Thai recently among friends and we finally got a chance to try after our 3rd time visit. We highly recommend to make your reservation ahead or come right after they open. We were there at 5:15pm on a Friday night and there were only 3 tables for 2 left at that time. Their service was energetic, attentive and friendly. We really enjoyed the causal and relaxed ambiance there. Firstly, the staff served the complimentary shrimp chip with matched sauce. We ordered grilled pork cheeks as our appetizer, the pork cheek was well grilled, tender and tasty, definitely a must order. Our entrees were Crab Aob Woonsen and Coconut crab curry, both dish were extremely delicious and addictive. We also love their Pak Boong Fai Dang, fried morning glory with fish sauce, which was the best match with rice.
Amazing Thai food. We arrived around 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon, and were able to sit at the bar right away. There's a coat/ bag check, which is great. We ordered the happy hour $1 oysters- not my favorite, but the toppings were fun and different.The crab curry is a MUST! Would not recommend if you don't like spicy food, but for me, it was the perfect amount of spice! So so delicious. We also had Thai iced tea and limeade, both of which were fresh and tasty. Try this place for sure, make a reservation if you want to sit at a table!
I just ordered two items; the chicken wings and the crab fried rice. Might be the most delicious things I've tasted!
Best date night spot! This place is consistently delicious, spicy, and different. This isn't your ordinary pad Thai- Thai food place. They have a range of unique dishes and I suppose the name hints at this but their fish dishes are phenomenal. Also their $1 oysters are great but kind of dangerous because I feel like I could easily eat 50. Try their whole fish dishes. Seriously just the best. In terms of ambiance, it's definitely a bit loud but I like it. It's nice soft lighting and if you're there on a date, you don't have to scream to hear each other. It's fun & romantic all at once.
Cute spot. Cute color schemes for the interior. Cute name. Aww. Let's get straight to the point!Ordered the Coconut Crab Curry. Crowd favorite. Makes sense because it was fantastic. The coconut cream gives the curry a silky, velvety texture that goes super well with the rice it comes with and of course, the abundant crab meat in the curry. They do not skimp on that, thankfully. Their Crab Aob Woonsen is surprisingly modest in terms of its portions. I feel like they should have also added a bit more sauce in it. The glass noodles could definitely have used some extra flavors. The crab meat was good, but not as good as the ones sitting in the Coconut Curry. The pork belly slices are also a little.. stale in both flavor and appearance. I definitely recommend the Coconut Crab Curry over the Woonsen. Standard Thai Iced Tea. I like mine a bit more on the bitter side, but I'm not going to complain about something sweet. Their homemade coconut ice cream with jackfruit and whatever else was also pretty good. Definitely need to share it with though, it's kinda hefty. I had a Spicy Mango cocktail for their happy hour price of $10. It's good. Not too strong, not too weak. Right down the middle. Nothing like needing to use the bathroom the rest of the day after starting with a drink.
Gotta love a place with happy hour on the weekends!! We went for lunch happy hour and I have to say the coktsil for $10 is the right pricee (normal price $15) The thai old fashioned and the spicy mango were pur favorites (we also tried butterfly effect - very sweet, and the something cheeks which had nice thai bass flavor but was pretty boring would be better with a different spirit than vodka) The happy hour ohsters were $1 and they were amazing because they came ¬ out super fast (we werevstarving) and they had a crispy shallot garnish that was awesome as well as a green ""seafood"" sauce that was very flavorful. I dont often eat oysters w crispy garnishes so that was fun. We ordered the coconut crab curry, the fried fish, and the Grilled Pork Cheeks. The fried fish is one of thee best dishes I've had in a long time!! I was so impressed by the cook on it, it was fried super crispy but the inside was perfectly done nice and flaky and steamy. The ggarnish has some tthai bird chilis and they are HOT, after my first bite I made sure I had no more than one chili per bite to try to control the spice level. The curry is also very good and quite spicy, tho more of a slow burn that the chilis with the fish. It was a bit hard to eat, I wish thety served it with bowls instead of plates. You get GIANT chunks of crab, probably some off the biggest I've seen at a restaurant and they are tender and sweet in the spicy curry. Pork cheeks were cooked well and the sauce is tasty but nothing super special there. The coco nut ice cream for dessert is a hige two scoop portion which is ¬ perfect to cool you down after those chilis. A great serving size for $9I would come back for sure and get the fried fish and try some other dishes!!",Seafood
5,kotobuki,mostrecommended2,"FOODCrispy rice spicy tuna app was delicious! Definitely getting those again. Perfectly sized bites. Sushi deluxe (12 nigiri + California roll + salad + miso soup) was solid with sizable pieces and a good variety. ¬ Loved the salmon and eel. SERVICEQuick to seat us and take orders. One con was how they swiped away a few small dishes with food still left in them without asking whether we were done. Other than that, everything was fine. ATMOSPHERE Pretty busy and loud on a Sunday night. Lots of young groups of friends. Didn't have trouble hearing my friend but we definitely had to talk a little louder.
Recommend: not really. Just a mediocre sushi place Sushi Sashimi Food Atmosphere Service
Pretty decent sushi at an above average price. I came here with a friend after eyeing their menu for the past few months, but finally decided to bite and try out one of their gigantic sushi platters. I got the sushi and sashimi for 2, which is $80 for a massive sushi platter. It's beautifully arranged, with the sashimi on one side, the nigiri right next to it, and finally the rolls on the other side. It's a very instagramable plate of food with plenty of color. This platter also comes with soup, salad, and also deep fried oysters which I did not expect. It makes for a very filling meal, but still a tad bit pricey in my opinion. The quality was definitely better than your average run of the mill sushi joint. The service was quick and efficient, and I never had to flag someone down to refill my water either. What I didn't like about the restaurant was the ambiance, as it was so loud and crowded. There was very minimal lighting and it was difficult to talk to the person I was dining with over the music and the loudness of everyone else.
BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. Kotobuki's portions are generous and the price point, extremely reasonable. I came here on Christmas Eve for dinner and it was packed; thankfully, they accepted reservations so we didn't have to wait at all.Sushi & sashimi platter for 3 ($120) - this was a LOT of stuff. If your party didn't order any entrees or appetizers, you'll be stuffed with this alone. I think it'd be the perfect amount for a party of 4 to eat if nothing else was ordered. I shared it with 5 other people in my party and though I didn't order an entree, my stomach was super content (and extremely stuffed) by the end of the night. We were also served miso soup, a small salad, and fried oysters. Side note: this platter is predominantly tuna-based...I felt it lacked in fish variety!My friends ordered a bento set, gyoza, beef yaki udon, and katsu chicken. I found those to be just okay but I highly recommend their sushi & sashimi for the value!
Couldn't decide on what to order as I was wanting everything on the menu. So I've decided to order the bento box with chicken; best decision ever! The bento box came with soup, salad, California rolls, shrimp tempura, goyzas, teriyaki chicken, and a bowl of rice. For the price of $26, definitely was worth every penny, did I mention - I devoured everything? Good quality food and fast service!
Came here on a weeknight with my friend who has been here before. We were craving sushi and she mentioned that Kotobuki was really good so obviously I agreed to give it a try.We popped in for an early dinner so I don't think a reservation was required. At 5:45pm, the restaurant was pretty quiet and there was tons of seating available. I'll also note that I really liked the ambiance and decor here. This restaurant is not only easy on the eyes though. It's also spotless which I definitely appreciated.My friend wanted to try the K-Mac sliders and I'm really happy we did. I'd even go as far as saying this was the highlight of the meal. The sliders, chopped tuna, rice, tempura flakes, avo,romaine, & spicy mayo in a rice cracker ""bun"" came with 2 per order ($9.50) and were delicious. They were a bit messy so you probably shouldn't order this if you're on a first date (or maybe you should, just so the other person knows what they're getting themselves into lol). Believe the hype on these!For our entrees, we went a little too hard and over-ordered as we normally do. We EACH ordered the sushi/sashimi combo with 4 nigiri, 8 sashimi, salmon carpaccio, cali, and u.f.o. roll ($27 each). We clearly did not need that much food and should have just split this because I was full after just a few bites. I'll note here that the quality of the fish isn't amazing (more like something you'd get from a takeout spot), and some pieces of tuna were a little TOO fishy, so I don't think I'd order this again. I'd prob just split those K-Mac sliders again and order a specialty roll of some sort. Also, u.f.o. roll wasn't my favorite (fish quality-aside) because it was wrapped in daikon. Not necessarily a flavor and texture I enjoy. I will conclude by saying that the service was LOVELY and very accommodating. The staff took my sesame seed allergy seriously which, unfortunately, is not something many sushi restaurants do. Our servers were sweet and quick with our orders. No complaints here at all. I'd visit again since I'm already dreaming about those sliders, but I'd order a different entree.
Loved the complimentary potato noodle with soy and vinegar when you sit down.The seafood is good quality, they go little crazy with mayo and dressing and whatnot for my taste. I really enjoyed my eel avocado hand roll and the gyoza- staight forward, solid, no surprises. The Viaduct was good but one of the more dressed up options: rolled pepper tuna, combined with seafood salad, cucumber, topped with our yuzu-jalape√±o chili sauce. I liked what they were going for but thought the sauce was too sweet. The salmon and avocado salad was a surprising miss. Salmon sashimi, avocado, cucumber, with a spicy mayo dressing. They threw in two asparagus spears not included in the description, and the dressing had a surprising amount of vinegar flavor. There was really no texture, not enough cucumber to take away from the creaminess of the avocado, mayo, and soft salmon. Skip this.Service was sweet.
It's pretty hard to find an authentic sushi spot in NYC for a decent price. It's either a hit or miss. Kotobuki fell in between that and offered quality sushi at an affordable price. The sushi was good and fresh, but nothing out of this world. Sometimes the rolls we ordered were a little too large and had to be consumed in two bites rather than one. The sake we ordered was fantastic and was a great compliment with the meal. You do get a small complimentary bowl of cold noodle (forgot what this was called) when you sit down, which is a nice plus. I'll try this spot again for lunch.
I tried out Kotobuki with three friends and we were thoroughly impressed. We ordered the sushi and sashimi set for three and it definitely fed the four of us very well. It contained 3 soups and salads, six oysters, 30 pieces of sashimi, 15 pieces of sushi (assorted raw fish on rice) and 7 different rolls. We didn't get to choose the rolls but I have a crustacean allergy and they were very accommodating with allowing us to switch it to another roll of our choice. Our waitress was so nice and patient. She had to repeat herself multiple times because we couldn't hear her over the girls in the table next to us. The restaurant had great ambiance and will be perfect for dates or just friend gatherings. I think I'm going to bring my parents here for my fathers birthday next year!
Disaster. Ordered take out and was told 1 hour. When we showed up the entrance was packed, no staff around, waited a few minutes and it just got worse. We left without food after being in a crowded space for 10 minutes. This is beyond irresponsible and dangerous for both clients and staff. Restaurants like this should not be allowed to operate during covid restrictions. I called a different location and asked if it was possible to speak with management and was told the owner was too busy.
One of my favorite sushi places ever and I have been to a lot! They have creative rolls and you may feel skeptical on whether it will taste good at first but it turns out AMAZING. I didn't think I would like a sushi roll with asparagus in it but Kotobuki's sushi is just heavenly. I can't remember what roll I got exactly but I think any roll from here will satisfy your sushi craving! The inside of the restaurant is also very cute and relaxed.
Another great restaurant found in East Village! Loved the modern decor and how spacious it is. Tables are kind of close to each other but guess they want to accommodate as many customers as possible. We were there around 6pm on a Friday night and it wasn't too busy yet. We got seated right away without reservation. Very thoughtful of the restaurant to provide hot towel for customers to wipe our hands. Seems like most fellow yelpers raved about the sushi and sashimi and the food certainly did not disappoint. My boyfriend got the combo which was a nice set. Fresh sashimi and very generous pieces as well. I opted for the pork Katsu which again was a big portion. Both entrees came with miso soup and green salad. Service was quick and we finished our meals in less than one hour as we had to catch a movie at a nearby AMC. Would definitely be back. PS: the restaurant was packed around 9:30pm when we passed by it after the movie.
HORRIBLE delivery service- forgot to include one of our items and when we called, the manager hung up when requesting to have it re-sent. We were told that it was 'Uber Eats problem'. Please be aware when ordering.
Oh god how did I not rate this spot. This is the absolute best spot for sushi/ Asian fusion appetizers in the city. Omakase lovers not for you. This spot holds a special place in my heart, that makes me and my gals return religiously. Whether it's this location or the one in LI, we are obsessed! The food is always 10/10, not less. Service is always 10/10, never less. Gotta get here for 5pm because it gets busy and you will wait! The fried oysters are magical, yellowtail jalape ±o is to die for, k Mac sliders finger licking good, crispy rice is good too, crazy tuna roll is outstanding, I can keep going.... just try it !!
CORONAVIRUS REVIEW: Do not go here. Simply put, this is the worst situation you could possibly find. I did pick up and they cram you in the tiny entrance way with all the delivery orders. Social distancing wasn't a thing. Imagine being packed in a room on a Saturday night during regular times trying to navigate a bar or nightclub. In addition to that, they leave the completed orders on a table next to the crowd and everyone from the crowd touches each order because it is taking hours. The 2 individuals that are taking orders and touching credit cards are also packing the bags - meaning they touch someone's stuff and immediately touch your food / chopsticks etc without washing hands. I had to wait 1.5 hours after Postmates said our order was ready. I asked multiple times forUpdates having to fight through the crowd only to get a simple F off from staff. After 1.5 hours I left and they still charged my CC. I had to alert postmates and do a chargeback. I would never go back and I went frequently. Based upon how they treat sanitary conditions during extreme times, imagine the lack of care they will have when life gets back to normal.
I came here for lunch and ordered a chirashi. It came with a soup and salad. The fish was very fresh. They give out hot towels for you to wipe your hands with. I enjoyed the decor while waiting for the food! Good choice for a quick lunch. Food came quickly. Would definitely come again!
Delicious and inventive sushi, quick and attentive service, prices are standard for the neighborhood. I had a salmon bento box which was a lot of food, could barely finish it. My friend got a pink roll that looked super cute and unique, maybe could've had less crab salad in it. I'll definitely come back and try their dinner menu.
I came here on a Monday night with two girlfriends. I was the first to arrive and texted them ""This place is cute and bumpin inside!"" which is exactly what it was...even for a Monday! We made a reservation about an hour before but I think it helped since it gets busy. All of the food was really good! We ordered the crispy rice with tuna, pork fried dumplings, and two different specialty rolls. The free noodles to start were definitely a bonus too. At first our server came over what felt like every minute to ask if we were ready when we had not even picked up the menu but then later on it felt impossible to get their attention when we wanted to order more. ¬ Ambiance was fun, little bit on the noisy side and sushi was reasonably priced for what you get.
Good food and service. Ordered the shrimp and vegetable tempura and the rainbow bright roll to go. They were out of the toro for the roll and offered to sub with salmon belly, which turns out they also were out of, so then they subbed with yellowtail belly. I appreciated they tried to make it work. My only complaint is the fish slices on top were razor thin. The tempura was very good... light like it should be and not the thick batter you sometimes encounter in some Japanese restaurants. They also offered hot green tea while I waited which was really nice... especially since it was 30 degrees outside and windy.",Japanese
6,Au_zur,mostrecommended3,"Delicious flavored food; great concept to show off in front of guests. Definetely pricey & service was off. But recommend trying at least once if your in the mood for lots of gyroTip; ask for extra garlic sauce
I went here on Thanksgiving day after seeing the chicken shawarma go viral on social media this summer. The seating is snug and staff is polite, and the clientele on thanksgiving, was largely made of Middle Easterner diners, already signaling that the food was the real deal. As someone who has lived and dined extensively through UAE, the shawarma is sacred. The visual experience of grilling it on the spit by yourself while pecking at the mound of fries with the mezze and garlic sauce gets your appetite working, and then the magic begins. When I shared it with another person, we had leftovers for the next day, even though we skipped breakfast and showed up hungry and early at 5 PM. My vegetarian friend was a fan of the falafel pizza. After caving into the hype and trying the shawarma our first time, I'm looking forward to trying the rest this place has to offer - a mixed grill, some mezze and hamous bi lahmeh are on my radar.
Late night Lebanese that isn't a counter service place? Sign me up. You know how it is. Sometimes you just want some midnight mezze and a decent glass of wine (or craft cocktail). You're vegan and Middle Eastern food always satisfies because hummus, falafel etc. really hits the spot. Add in cool environs + sidewalk cafe and you've got Au Za'atar (one of my favorite spice blends, I might add). There's a sizzling meat platter that is a little disturbing, not gonna lie ¬ (tableside schwarma) but dang, you do you. It's popular here and it's served with a goddamned considerable MOUND of za'atar fries. I'll take just the fries, please. Leave that mountain of meat to someone else. I'll also take a zillion other small plates that are picture-perfect (I think I'm going to buy their cookbook and make some at home).This place is heavenly. Just thinking about it makes me happy. I can't wait for reopening and I'm putting it on my list of top places I'm hitting up first.
Came here on a date night with my husband because of the instagrammable nature of this restaurant and we certainly were not disappointed! We ordered the chicken shawarma with fries, which is technically an off the menu special, but pretty much everyone gets it, along with falafel and a zatar flatbread to start. Everything was good, but my favourite part was hands down the multiple sauces they provided you with. The zatar mayo was addictive, I wish I could have taken a bucket of it home with me!!The chicken shawarma was great with the naan and fries they served but it was so much food, I honestly do not recommend ordering this for just two people! You need at least 4 to polish it off, and even still you may have some leftovers! For dessert (we had to save some room!!) we ordered mint tea and Lebanese tea, with baklava. The baklava serving was quite small for the price, but overall delish! Would recommend, but only if going with a group!
If you're looking for a fun dining experience in NYC, you'll find it here with their tableside shawarma. Assuming the photos didn't entice you already.. First, I would recommend making a reservation because this place is packed. The shawarma costs roughly $80-90 depending on which meat you want (chicken, beef, lamb). They say it's good for 3-4 people, but in our group I think 5 is still a solid number. The set up is phenomenal, but be prepared to wait an additional 45-60 minutes to get your food. We got the chicken shawarma and it was super delicious. The chicken in itself wasn't as flavored, but the fries are super seasoned and balances the meat well. At the bottom of the stack of fries, you'll find pita pockets where you can stuff the goodies. You'll get a variety of sauces, pickles, and radishes to accompany your meal. It's a feast, it's fun and you should definitely come in a group! The service is great and they always 
come by filling your water and helping you cut your meats. I would recommend coming through to try this place!
I was visiting family in New York (I'm a LA native) and my cousin recommended this spot that she, too, had been wanting to try. We got a few things plus the rotating chicken shawarma on fries. It was divine! The food is flavorful and the quantity is very fulfilling. It's a cute little quaint place inside and I absolutely love the decor. It can be a tad bit squishy, so you might be elbow-to-elbow with the party sitting next to you. If you are in the area, I would absolutely recommend this place for you to try at least once!
I came here on a Saturday for a date. We didn't make a reservation so we waited 30 minutes until they texted us at a bar around the corner. We got seated at a high-top at the bar. We got a bunch of small things to try and it was all really good. We also ordered a bottle of Lebanese wine that the bartender recommended and it was great. Prices were fair and the aesthetics are beautiful. I would highly recommend.
It's all about the spices! Most people come here for the tableside shwarma but my friend and I stuck with the vegetarian menu. This menu is extensive and definitely accommodates all types of diners. We tried the following:- Muhammara: spicy and sweet pepper dip with walnuts and pomegranate molasses - THIS needs to be incorporated in my daily diet. The blend of flavors explodes in your mouth with every bite. We cleaned this plate. - Fattet Al-Betenjane: eggplant with crispy pita smothered in a yogurt sauce. Honestly the pepper dip was so flavorful, it kind of stole the show. But this dish was fairly good. - Spicy Falafel: man oh man, crisp to perfection and even better when you wrap it in a blanket of pita, dip it into the garlic dip and you can go to bed happy. Last but not least, the unlimited pita is something ELSE. Warm, soft, but crisp at the bottom. It was the perfect amount of thickness, I think I ate my weight in pita and I'm not even mad about it. DEFINITELY need to return here to try their meat shawarmas!!! Space is very cramped so make sure you make a reservation beforehand.
If you're passing by the east village, make sure to stop by Au Za'atar. The place can get busy so make sure you get a reservation and bring a big appetite. They are known for their infamous table side shawerma skewers (lamb, $98). These are good for 3-4 people. There are also beef ($98) and chicken ($78) shawerma options. These aren't on the menu so you have to ask for them. Service was great and friendly, this was our second visit to Au Za'atar. Highly recommend you pair the shawerma with the arnabeet mekle (easily one of our favorites here), tabouli salad, and hummus to complete a great dinner experience. Can't go wrong with any of their appetizers, the flavors are a hit every time!
This is probably one of my favorite places to take my friends when they're in town. It's easy to make a reservation, food is freshly made, and servers are extremely accommodating. I made a reservation through open table and they confirmed the day before -- love when restaurants do this. Honestly, it just shows how organized they are. When we arrived, our table was already set, and we had a jug of water waiting for us. Waiter was quick to explain the menu, and gave us some great suggestions. We ordered the personal lamb shawarma for the table -- as photographed. It speaks for itself! Comes with some vegetables, fries, and sauces. Probably one of the more fun dining experience I've had!
After getting my feeds flooded with insider and buzzfeed videos of the large rotating skewer machines warming the meat towers, I basically had no choice but to make a stop here and try them out.The concept is simple. Build your own pita pocket from a multitude of fillings laid out in front of you: meat, tomatoes, onions, and your choice of garlic / za'atar / hummus...we were even told to put fries inside, which I'm glad the server mentioned because I probably would've been too shy to do so otherwise.One beef and one lamb was the perfect size for us 8. Without drinks and all the add-ons, it came out to be about $25 per person, which is a bit steep for the portions, but perhaps excusable for the novelty.I suppose targeted ads do sometimes work.....
If you're in the lower east side... go to au za'atar. Seriously I've been here probably 12x in the last 7 months. The food is unbelievable especially the personal Shawarma and the fries. The fries are seasoned with a tasty dry rub and onion. It's a genius way to serve fries. The only bad thing is the seating inside is a little crammed but your in NYC, that stuff should be normal. I'm gonna try to make it 20x in a year haha!Eat here.
If this is your first foray into middle eastern, specifically, Lebanese food, by all means go to town, and have a blast with it. The food, I have to admit, is pretty good. We ordered the spicy hummus and falafels to start off our meal. The hummus was alright but the falafels were perfect. I don't say this often because so many people screw up falafels. Au Za'atar is not one of them. The menu is halal if that is what you seek but please note that the establishment does serve alcohol. If you literally know nothing about lebanese food, order the Shawarma. They have chicken, beef, and lamb. Each platter can generously feed 4-5 people if you order appetizers. Pay attention to the accompaniments!! DO NOT SKIMP on the pickles, the zataar mayo and the toum. If you don't know, toum is very difficult to make so help yourself to a generous serving. Again, do not skimp on the pickles. When your shawarma platter comes with its mountain of fries, assemble it all in your pita and make sure to slather on the accompaniments. If you follow my directions, you will have a delectable, and very tasty meal. So you might ask why 3 stars? While I kept saying do not skimp on the pickles, unfortunately, the restaurant did. The service was not great. Our waitress was not easily available and that's a little important when your server is the carver for your shawarma platter. Another reason for the 3 start: Skip the dessert. We ordered the knafeh and the chocolate souffle. The knafeh was overly sweet and not well done. The chocolate souffle was basically a chocolate lava cake. It tasted okay but I have different visions when I picture souffle. Overall, would I come back? Maybe? Probably if someone else was paying.
Professional. Professional. Look up the definition. And this is it. I normally don't lead in with a comment about the service but I was truly impressed by the level of professionalism and the way the manager handled a very challenging situation with such swift and gracious motions. It was the textbook of what a restaurant's customer service should embody. Another party had arrived with cake, which they hadn't realized was not allowed to be served in the restaurant. The rule was explained to them that it was only fair to the other parties who also had birthdays. I grabbed my popcorn and anticipated a showdown. I kid, of course. The manager was called over. They were getting more anxious as the surprise guest was arriving. Situation was explained how it was a surprise event. He thought for a moment. And unwaveringly said. Let me tell you what I can do for you. I will bring out one of our desserts for your friend add a candle. Make it a celebration. And boy did my group sing hard for them! He stuck to his position. Offered a solution. Satisfied the party without compromising the stance of the restaurant. It was beautiful. Anyway to the food! Amazing!! We didn't get to try the giant spit roast that everyone raves about since there was only us three in the group. But the meat platter we had was so on point. My favorite was the appetizer. Beautiful pita chips lining the dip. Oof that pita bread would leave me thinking about it for days. I tried the non alcoholic date drink. What a pleasant and unique surprise. You gotta like that date taste but it was just delightful. Dessert: Baklava, knafeh, and the coffee were amazing!! The coffee had notes of cardamom that just knocked it outta the park I can't wait to come back. Hopefully try that giant table side Shawarma and fries next time. But let me tell you the way a place handles difficult Situations really says a lot about them A+.
**this review is a year old**Cons: Gimmicky. Fries heavy. Barely any meat. Takes patience and labor. Meh location. Poor service Pros: halal, zabiha, gram worthy
I came to New York with my friend and we met another friend who recommended this place for us. It is a really nice, cozy place. Food quality was really good and the quantity was really a lot. people were nice and I would definitely go come back.
Great place to experience a Mediterranean ""feel"". The service is great. Servers are very welcoming and personable. The food comes in abundance. The entire sharwerma rack can feed a full table. It's kind of tight though, granted it's in the city. Also, limited space causes all these cords to tangle on the floor. They are used to heat up the sharwema (which is also so close to your face on the table which isn't so comfortable). Not sure if there's a way to control this...
Went here for my friend's birthday dinner and had a great experience! Despite it being a bustling Saturday night and our party being over 10 people, the waitstaff was extremely accommodating. The service was prompt and high quality, which we appreciated greatly since we needed to be in and out (relatively) quickly. I shared the Halloum cheese as well as the Riz a Djaj with another friend, and both together were great portions of food, not to mention very flavorful and delicious! Afterwards, we enjoyed the Lebanese coffee pot and even got our cups read!
Second time I have been to this place. The food ¬ is exceptional. And our server Rachid was wonderful, extremely attentive and pleasant. Shukran!",Wine bar
